                      TITANIC CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM

On April 15, 1912, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. When the 
Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the
international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck 
resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was 
some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
The file contains data of the real Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different 
attributes about the person including whether they survived , their age , their passenger-class , their sex  
and the fare they paid .

The data has been split into two groups:
•	training set (train.csv)
•	test set (test.csv)
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models.  

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, actual output is
not provided. You need  to predict the target variable (survived).  For each passenger in the test set, use the model 
you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.   

What you need to submit is the following 

1.Problem Description and Objective

2 Feature Analysis

3. Visualization

4. Model building with  atleast 3 Classification  Models (using different algorithms)

5.  Evaluate and Get the accuracy

6. Do a prediction using Test data provided

7. Use ensemble methods to improve the accuracy

Note :  Please note that all the  7 sections above are equally important for the case study.
